## Project Overview
This data science project aims to predict individual medical costs using a dataset containing various attributes related to health insurance. The project focuses on analyzing features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and predicting the corresponding medical costs.

### Summary and Conclusion

In this project, I focused on predicting medical costs using various data preprocessing techniques and machine learning models. The steps and methodologies employed are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Age Categorization: The age of individuals was converted into categorical variables to enhance model performance.
   - Outlier Removal: Outliers were identified and removed from the dataset to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Appropriate visualizations were created to explore and understand the data patterns and relationships, providing valuable insights into the dataset.

3. Data Standardization and Label Encoding:
   - Data standardization was performed to normalize the features.
   - Label encoding was applied to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

4. Model Training and Ensemble Learning:
   - Two models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, were trained on the processed dataset.
   - These models were combined using an ensemble approach to leverage their strengths and improve overall accuracy.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - The ensemble model achieved a final accuracy of 88.6%.

These steps ensured a comprehensive analysis and model training process, leading to a robust prediction model for medical costs.
